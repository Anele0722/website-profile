## Challenges Faced

During the development of this project, several challenges were encountered. 

1. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring that the website looks and functions well across different devices and screen sizes posed a significant challenge. This was addressed by implementing CSS media queries and testing the website on various devices and screen resolutions.

2. **Video Background**: Integrating a video background while maintaining optimal performance was challenging. To address this, the video was optimized for web use, and the autoplay feature was implemented with consideration for user experience and bandwidth usage.

3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring consistent functionality and appearance across different web browsers presented a challenge. This was tackled by testing the website on multiple browsers and making adjustments to the CSS

Each challenge was approached with a problem-solving mindset, and solutions were found through research, and experimentation.
